		<p><b>Thoroughly clean your hands.</b> Use alcohol-based hand rub or soap. <i>This kills viruses that may be on your hands.</i></p>
		<p><b>Maintain at least 6 feet between yourself and others.</b> When someone coughs, sneezes, or speaks they spread small infectious droplets. If you are too close, you may breathe in these droplets and become infected with COVID-19 if the person is a carrier.</p>
		<p><b>Avoid crowded places.</b> Harder to maintain distance of 6 feet, more likely to have close contact with someone that has COVID-19. </p>
		<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hand. Viruses enter your body through these places if you touch them with contaminated hands.</p>

		<p><b>When you cough or sneeze, use your bent elbow or a tissue to cover your mouth and nose.</b> Afterwards, immediately and wash your hands. If you are infected, droplets spread virus. </p>
		<p><b>Self-isolate if you have minor symptoms (cough, headache, mild fever).</b> Have someone deliver you supplies. If you must leave your house, be sure to wear a mask. Avoid contact with others to protect them from possible COVID-19.</p>
		<p><b>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention by calling in advance.</b> Calling in advance allows the health care workers to direct you to the right health facility. This not only protects you but also helps prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
		<p><b>Get the latest information from trusted sources.</b> Some examples include WHO or your local and national health authorities.</p>
